      🍖 Mutton Biryani Recipe (Serves 4–5)
Ingredients:
For Marination:

750g mutton (goat/lamb, bone-in for best flavor)

1 cup thick yogurt (curd)

2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste

2 tsp red chili powder

1 tsp turmeric powder

2 tsp coriander powder

1 tsp garam masala powder

1 tbsp lemon juice

Salt to taste

For the Rice:

2.5 cups basmati rice (soaked 30 mins, drained)

5 cups water

2–3 cloves

2 green cardamoms

1 black cardamom (optional)

1 bay leaf

1-inch cinnamon stick

1 star anise (optional, for extra aroma)

1 tsp salt

For Biryani Assembly:

3 large onions (thinly sliced, fried golden brown — birista)

3 green chilies (slit)

3 tbsp ghee or oil

2 tbsp fresh coriander leaves (chopped)

2 tbsp mint leaves (chopped)

A pinch of saffron soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk (or ½ tsp food color in milk)

Instructions:
1. Marinate the Mutton

Mix mutton with yogurt, spices, lemon juice, and salt.

Marinate for at least 2 hours (overnight is best for tenderness).

2. Cook the Mutton

Heat ghee/oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker.

Add marinated mutton and cook until browned.

Add 1–2 cups water, cover, and cook until mutton is 80% tender (30–40 mins in a handi, 15–20 mins in a pressure cooker).

3. Cook the Rice

Boil water with whole spices and salt.

Add soaked rice and cook until 70% done.

Drain and set aside.

4. Layering the Biryani

In a large handi or heavy pot, spread half the rice over cooked mutton.

Top with fried onions, mint, coriander, and saffron milk.

Repeat with remaining rice and garnishes.

Drizzle 1 tsp ghee over the top.

5. Dum Cooking (Sealed Steaming)

Seal the lid with dough or a tight cover.

Cook on very low flame for 25–30 minutes.

Let it rest for 10 minutes before opening.
