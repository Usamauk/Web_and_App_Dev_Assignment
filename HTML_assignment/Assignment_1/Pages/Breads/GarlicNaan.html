        🧄 Garlic Naan Recipe (Serves 4–5)
Ingredients:
For Dough:

2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)

1 tsp sugar

½ tsp salt

1 tsp baking powder

½ tsp baking soda

2 tbsp oil or melted ghee

½ cup yogurt (curd)

Warm water (as needed to knead dough)

For Topping:

4–5 garlic cloves (finely chopped or grated)

2 tbsp fresh coriander leaves (finely chopped)

2 tbsp melted butter or ghee

Instructions:

Make the Dough

In a bowl, mix flour, salt, sugar, baking powder, and soda.

Add yogurt and oil, mix well.

Slowly add warm water and knead into a soft dough.

Cover and rest for 1–2 hours.

Prepare Garlic Butter

Mix melted butter with chopped garlic and coriander. Keep aside.

Shape the Naan

Divide dough into equal balls.

Roll out into oval/round naan shape (not too thin).

Add Topping

Brush the top side with garlic butter mix.

Lightly press so garlic sticks to naan.

Cooking Methods

Tandoor/Oven (250°C preheated): Place naan inside until puffed and golden.

Tawa Method: Heat tawa, apply water on the plain side, stick it to hot tawa (wet side down). Cook until bubbles appear, then flip directly over flame for smoky effect.

Finish

Brush with extra butter and serve hot.

🍽️ Serving Suggestion:

Best with butter chicken, paneer butter masala, dal makhni, or korma dishes.
