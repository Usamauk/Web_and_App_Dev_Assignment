Ingredients:
For the Chicken:

600g chicken (bone-in or boneless, cut into medium pieces)

1 cup thick yogurt (whisked)

2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste

2 medium onions (thinly sliced)

3 tbsp oil or ghee

2 green chilies (slit)

2 tbsp fresh cream (optional, for extra richness)

Salt to taste

For the Korma Masala Paste:

10–12 cashews OR 2 tbsp almonds (soaked)

1 tbsp poppy seeds (optional, for thickness)

2 tbsp fresh grated coconut (optional, South-style)

1 tsp fennel seeds

4–5 cloves

3–4 green cardamoms

1-inch cinnamon stick

5–6 black peppercorns

(Grind all into a smooth paste with a little water.)

Spices:

1 tsp turmeric powder

2 tsp coriander powder

1 tsp red chili powder

1 tsp garam masala powder

Instructions:

Prepare Masala Paste

Blend soaked nuts, spices, and poppy seeds into a smooth paste. Set aside.

Fry Onions (Birista style)

Heat oil/ghee in a pan.

Fry onions until golden brown. Remove half for garnish, leave the rest in the pan.

Cook Chicken

Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Sauté until aromatic.

Add chicken pieces, sear on medium heat.

Add Masala & Yogurt

Mix in turmeric, coriander, chili powder, and salt.

Add the ground korma paste, stir well.

Lower flame and add whisked yogurt slowly, stirring continuously to prevent curdling.

Simmer

Add ½–1 cup water (adjust consistency).

Cover and cook until chicken is tender (20–25 mins).

Finish with garam masala and cream (optional).

Garnish & Serve

Top with reserved fried onions, fresh coriander, and a drizzle of ghee.
