      🥘 Ingredients
For the beef:

1 kg beef (bone-in pieces work best)

2 large onions, thinly sliced

2 medium tomatoes, chopped

1 cup yogurt (whisked)

3–4 green chilies, slit

2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste

½ cup cooking oil or ghee

2 tbsp biryani masala (store-bought or homemade)

1 tsp red chili powder

1 tsp turmeric powder

1 tsp coriander powder

1 tsp cumin powder

½ tsp garam masala powder

Salt, to taste

Fresh coriander & mint leaves (a handful each, chopped)

For the rice:

3 cups basmati rice (soaked 30 minutes)

6 cups water

2–3 green cardamoms

1 bay leaf

1 small cinnamon stick

4–5 cloves

1 tsp salt

For layering:

A pinch of saffron soaked in ¼ cup warm milk (or ½ tsp yellow food color in milk)

Fried onions (optional, for garnish)

Extra mint and coriander leaves

👩‍🍳 Instructions
Step 1: Cook the beef

Heat oil/ghee in a heavy pot. Fry onions until golden brown.

Add ginger-garlic paste, sauté for 1 min.

Add beef pieces, fry until browned.

Add tomatoes, yogurt, and all powdered spices (except garam masala). Cook until oil separates and beef is coated well.

Add 2 cups water, cover, and cook on medium heat until beef is tender (use a pressure cooker/instant pot if you prefer faster cooking).

Once done, sprinkle garam masala, chopped coriander, and mint. Set aside.

Step 2: Cook the rice

Boil water with whole spices and salt.

Add soaked rice, cook until 70% done (the grains should still have a bite).

Drain and set aside.

Step 3: Layer the biryani

In a heavy-bottomed pot, spread a layer of beef masala.

Add a layer of rice over it.

Sprinkle some saffron milk, mint, and coriander.

Repeat layers until everything is used, finishing with rice on top.

Cover tightly (use a cloth or foil under the lid if needed).

Cook on low flame (dum) for 20–25 minutes.

Step 4: Serve

Gently fluff up the biryani before serving.

Garnish with fried onions, coriander, and mint.

Serve hot with raita, salad, or pickle.
